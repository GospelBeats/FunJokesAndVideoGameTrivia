This was a team project where we utilized 2 separate APIs in a single application. One API was used to generate a random joke with a punchline. The interface prompted the end user to click a button for a random joke. Once the user clicks the button, a random joke appears along with another button to reveal the punchline. The other API was used to generate a random question about video game trivia. 'On Click' the user is presented with a random True/False question. Once the user answers the question, they are prompted with a message letting them know if the answer is correct or not.
